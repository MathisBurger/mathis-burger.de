Hi, I am Mathis Burger, a german Fullstack developer.
I like to use languages like Rust, Go and Javascript (Typescript), PHP and C#
I have a ton of different projects running. Most of them are on GitHub.
Furthermore, I love to gain knowledge about new frameworks and technologies.
Another point of interest of me is system-administration under linux based
operating systems. I am a big fan of devOps and docker.
I like to help other people to learn more about coding and tech.
Furthermore, I like to discuss problems and new technologies with other people.
