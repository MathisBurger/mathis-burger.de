Hi, I am Mathis Burger, a german dual Wirtschaftsinformatik student at AUDI AG and ex fullstack developer.
I love to use languages like Rust, Go and Javascript (Typescript), PHP and C# for my personal projects.
I have a ton of different small projects running. Most of them are on GitHub.
I do coding for fun not for living!
Nevertheless, I love to gain knowledge about new frameworks and technologies as well as
playing around with enterprise technologies.
Another point of interest of mine is event technology, especially lightning
technologies. I love to combine both of my interests and make the best out of it.
Finally, I also love cars and I am really deep into politics.
Some of the pictures are troll btw
