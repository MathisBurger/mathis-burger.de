Hi, I am Mathis Burger, a german Fullstack developer.
I like to use languages like Rust, Go and Javascript (Typescript), PHP and C#
I have a ton of different projects running. Most of them are on GitHub.
Furthermore, I love to gain knowledge about new frameworks and technologies.
Nevertheless, I love to play around with enterprise technologies, too.
Another point of interest of mine is event technology, especially lightning
technologies. I love to combine both of my interests and make the best out of it.
Some of the pictures are troll btw
