# Project information

This is my personal website. It includes much information about me and my projects in general. It also has its own
project portfolio, which shows the most important of my projects in a simple view. Furthermore, you have access to
a blog, that I created with next.js. I decided to use this webapp and not a wordpress instance for example, because it
is way easier to host for me, and I can design the blog like I want.

# Blog

The blog feature is a custom-built blogging API. I am able to add new blog entries by coding them. I have chosen this
method, because it is much more customizable, and I have full control over my blog. Furthermore, I think it is another
experience to code a blog instead of just writing it. Therefore, I decided to implement this easy blogging feature into
my portfolio webapp.

# Further development

I definitely want to add more blog posts to my personal webpage. Therefore, the project will grow regular. But, if I have
a nice idea I will add this as a new feature to my webpage. This project is timeless, because it represents my development
as a software engineer. I will add every project I am working on to this repository. 

# Contributing
It is useless to contribute to this project, because it represents my own portfolio. But if you want to write your own
blog post on my blog, feel free to do so and create a pull request, so I can edit it a little bit and merge it into
the current projects. Obviously, I will give you credits for that.
