Firstly, it includes dependency injection out of the box. That means, you can write your dependencies once and you do not have to reinitialize them every time you want to work with them. They are running as containers and you can access them whenever you want in your application. Furthermore, symfony provides some phpunit features with additional packages provided by symfony itself. So you can work with the symfony test case and test everything that has to do with symfony itself. This feature helps to increase your test case coverage through easy integration of the unit tests. To go on with, implementing a frontend like React, Vue.js or just a static HTML page is very easy by using the provided webpack config and the webpack bundle for symfony that is also provided by the symfony group itself."}),(0,a.jsx)("h1",{className:s().heading,children:"Database integration"}),(0,a.jsx)("p",{className:s().paragraph,children:"Implementing your database into your backend is one of the most complex and annoying things that have to be done. Creating migrations, data fixtures for testing and creating relations. All of that is very time consuming in other web frameworks. Symfony itself provides an easy to use database handler that is called doctrine. To use doctrine you have to provide an entity. It is just an php class with fields. Now you can define the behaviour and relations of the different entity-fields through annotations, which is very easy and readable. If you want to fetch data from the database, you can create a repository, which is an class, that provides some basic function for fetching data from the database, like findBy() or findOneBy(). You can easily extend this repository with your own functions by using doctrines QueryBuilder. Inserting new data is as easy as fetching data. There is an interface called ObjectManagerInterface. Just create a new Instance of your entity and set the fields like you want. After that you can persist your data through the ObjectManager with few lines of code. It is easy to read and easy to use. Furthermore doctrine provides an extra bundle for symfony that lets you create data fixtures for development. But the most amazing thing about symfony that is deep integrated into the symfony environment. You can easily create database migrations through a single symfony command and other symfony bundles are able to use your entities and repositories, because they are also using doctrine for databases. Therefore there are a lot of different bundles that are working with your database implementation. This is absolutely fantastic and I am missing this integration in other languages and frameworks like fiber for go or actix for rust.

Luckily, symfony provides also development bundles for debugging your symfony application. It provides a more detailed integration for xDebug, which is the common debugging server for php. Furthermore, symfony has the profiler bundle. It is an bundle that adds an toolbar to your webpage. It has very useful information like login information, caching and doctrine database queries. So it helps you a lot to understand what is going on under the hood and why your code might not work. But even if you are not using the symfony profiler, the development mode of symfony shows a good stack trace on your webpage, if something failed. Furthermore the page provides information about logs and exceptions that are thrown. So this might also help to debug your code faster that with other tools.

Symfony does things like password-hashing for you! Using a more complex algorithm for authorization like refresh token auth is also not a real problem. There are bundles that are implementing this behaviour. You can also use your doctrine entities for that. So you just have to install and configure the bundle as well as your endpoints for auth. It is done every quick and it is safe! So you do not have to think about how to implement a safe authorization.
